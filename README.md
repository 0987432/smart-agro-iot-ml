# Smart Agriculture using IoT and Machine Learning

This project focuses on creating a smart agriculture solution that integrates IoT sensors and machine learning models to:
- Detect rain and monitor weather conditions
- Recommend suitable crops for the detected conditions and season
- Optimize supply chain decisions for agricultural produce

## Features
- Rain detection using IoT sensors
- Crop recommendation based on weather and seasonal data
- ML-based prediction of environmental factors
- Basic supply chain management suggestions

## Technologies Used
- *IoT Hardware:* Rain sensors, DHT11/22 (for temperature & humidity)
- *Microcontroller:* Arduino / ESP32
- *ML Tools:* Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- *Backend:* Flask or FastAPI
- *Frontend (Optional):* HTML, CSS, JS Dashboard
- *Communication:* MQTT or Serial over USB
